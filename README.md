# Breast-Cancer-Prediction
This repo is created for the breast cancer prediction model, that is created using the wisconsin breast cancer dataset

Here in the main file there is the code to load the dataset and perform data preprocessing on the loaded data and then the model is created and trained with this dataset. model is also evaluated in this file.
The saved model and scalar is then saved in joblib files.

The saved joblib files are loaded and then a prediction is made for the user inputs using the model in predict.py.
